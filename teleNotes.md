   - It is important to enter in Islam from the tops of their heads to the tips of their toes so that
they are completely submerged in Islam.

- __Rule 2: Every Act of Worship is Haram__
   - Except if we have proof its from Quran or Sunnah.

- __Rule 3: Everything from the Worldly Affairs is Halal__
   - Being not used by the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) and his companions doesn’t make a thing impermissible, unless it is said to be forbidden.

- __Rule 4: A Worldly Matter is Placed into one of Five Categories__

   - <ins>Makrooh:</ins> these are not liked by Allah. i.e Eating onions and going to the mosque,by doing it we are not sinful but avoiding it is rewarded.
   - <ins>Haram:</ins> they are forbidden and sinful.

- __Rule 5: Things are Made Haram or Makrooh Using the Quran and Sunnah or the Scholars Deducing through Analogy__
   - Sometimes we have clear evidence that one thing is haram and sometimes with that analogy, other things can be made haram too.

      - For example, when scholars find out the alcohol is coming with different names, and they find out that alcohol is haram for its effects and intoxication.

   - What is harmful to our body is also impermissible in Shariah. Allah (SWT) said, do not kill
yourself with your hands.
